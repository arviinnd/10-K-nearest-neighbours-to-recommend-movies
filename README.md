Subject: use case on K nearest neighbours classifier to predict / recommend movies for the user <br>
<br>
Respected everyone,
  We have been given a problem on K nearest Neighbors classifier and the objective of the case study is to recommend / predict movies 
for users. We formulate a (Movie,User) matrix with the respective ratings as the entries so that the column vectors represent the 
ratings given to each movie by a particular user. We then map the matrix onto another matrix such that all non-zero entries are 
1 (watched the movie) and all other missing entries are 0 (not watched the movie). We then use the KNN classifier to predict the 
(watched/not watched ) vectors based on ratings. We calculate the Euclidean distance between the users , vary the order of the 
Minkowski distance and vary the number of nearest neighbors in the algorithm to check for accuracy changes. The changes have been 
calculated using train_test_split on training data as well as the model is computationally intensive.
